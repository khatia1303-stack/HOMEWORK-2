            <p><strong>Web development</strong> 
                is the work involved developing a

                for the 
                <a href="#">internet</a>

               network) <a href="#"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
               Web development can range from developing a simple single 
               <a href="#">static page</a>
               of 
               <a href="#">plain text</a> 
               to complex 
               <a href="#"> web <br> applications, electronic businesses</a>, 
               and

            Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the
                     main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing <br> 
                     markup and <a href="#">coding</a> <a href="#"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
                     Web development may use <a href="#"> content management systems </a>
                     (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with <br> basic technical skills.
        </div>
       <div>
    <p>For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people 
    ( <a href="#">Web developers</a> ) 
    and <br> 
    follow standard methods like
     <a href="#">Agile methodologies </a>
     while developing Web sites.
  <a href="#"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
        Smaller organizations may only require a <br> 
        single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions 
        such as a
       <a href="#">graphic designer</a> or <br>
       <a href="#">information sistems</a> 
       technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain <br>
        of a designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer specialization:
        <a href="#">front-end developer</a>,back-end developer, <br>
        and full-stack developer. 
        <a href="#"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
        Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while <br>
        back-end developers deal with the servers.
        <a href="#"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
         Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has 
         boomed and has <br>
         become one of the most used technologies ever.</p>

    <h2><strong>Origin/ Web 1.0</strong></h2>
</div>
<div>
    <a href="#">Tim Berners-Lee </a>
    created the
    <a href="#"> World Wide Web </a>
    in 1989 at 
    <a href="#"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
     <p>
        The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the automated 
        information-sharing needs of academics affiliated <br>
         with institutions and various global organizations. Consequently,
         <a href="#">HTML</a>
         was developed in 1993 <a href="#"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
     </p>
     <p>
        Web 1.0 is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only view material 
        and provide a small amount of <br>information.
        <a href="#"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
         Core protocols of web 1.0 were 
         <a href="#">HTML</a>
          HTML and
         <a href="#">URL</a>
         <a href="#"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
     </p>
     <p>
        In the realm of Web 2.0 environments, users now have access to a platform that 
        encourages sharing activities such as <br>
        creating music, files, images, and movies.
        <a href="#"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
        The architecture of Web 2.0 is often considered the "backbone of the internet," <br>
        using standardized 
        <a href="#">XML</a>
         (Extensible Markup Language) tags to authorize information flow from <br>
         independent platforms and
         <a href="#">online databases.</a>

     <div>
        <h2>Web 3.0</h2>
        <p>
            Web 3.0, considered the third and current version of the web, was introduced in 2014. 
            The concept envisions a complete <br> redesign of the web. Key features include the 
            integration of
            <a href="#">metadata</a> precise information delivery, and improved 
            <a href="#">user <br> experiences</a>
             based on preferences, history, and interests
             <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed"><sup>[citation needed]</sup></a></i></p>
             <p>
             Web 3.0 aims to turn the web into a sizable, organized database, providing more functionality than traditional 
             search engines. <br>
              Users can customize navigation based on their preferences, and the core ideas involve identifying 
              data sources, connecting <br> them for efficiency, and creating user profiles.

        <h2>Evolution of web development technologies</h2>
       <p>
        The journey of web development technologies began with simple
        <a href="#">HTML</a>
        pages in the early days of the internet. Over time, <br>
        advancements led to the incorporation of
        <a href="#">CSS</a>
        for styling and
        <a href="#">JavaScript</a>
        for interactivity. This evolution transformed static <br>
         websites into dynamic and responsive platforms, setting the stage for the complex 
         and feature-rich web applications we have <br>today.
